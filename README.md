# ONE-Robot
> A self-balancing unicycle robot based on IMU and STM32 made in 2015。

The warehouse contains the firmware source code of STM32 and the 3D model of the mechanical structure. The circuit of the control board is old and missing. But the circuit is very simple. It is basically a minimum system of STM32F103, which leads to two PWMs to control two motors; two timers are used to read encoder data; and several ADCs are used to read analog gyroscopes and accelerometers. Students who are interested in basic knowledge can study it by themselves~
